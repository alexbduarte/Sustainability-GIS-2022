    " - What does sustainability mean to you?\n",
    " - Did your idea / understanding about sustainability evolve somehow after the introductory presentation?\n",
    " - Are there (or have there been) some behaviors/actions in your life that you have changed due to sustainability reasons?\n",
    " - How do you think that as a *spatial data scientist/engineer* you could help to make a difference in terms of sustainability? \n",

In OSM, different administrative levels are tagged with `admin_level` tag (see [docs](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:boundary%3Dadministrative#admin_level)). These admin levels are used in order to render different borders consistently among countries. E.g `admin_level=10` is typically used to render districts, neighborhoods and so on, whereas `admin_level=4` is typically used to draw provinces, regions, federal states etc. These values are country specific, hence, if you work in other countries please take a look at the country specific table from the [OSM docs](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:boundary%3Dadministrative#admin_level). In Finland, `admin_level=10` is used for neighborhoods, hence you can take advantage of that information and extract all the neighborhoods for Helsinki Region.\n",
